TRAVIS=true
CONTINUOUS_INTEGRATION=true
DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
HAS_JOSH_K_SEAL_OF_APPROVAL=true
USER=travis
HOME is set to /home/travis on Linux, /Users/travis on MacOS, and /c/Users/travis on Windows.

Additionally, Travis CI sets environment variables you can use in your build, e.g. to tag the build, or to run post-build deployments.

TRAVIS_ALLOW_FAILURE:
set to true if the job is allowed to fail.
set to false if the job is not allowed to fail.
TRAVIS_APP_HOST: The name of the server compiling the build script. This server serves certain helper files (such as gimme, nvm, sbt) from /files to avoid external network calls; e.g., curl -O $TRAVIS_APP_HOST/files/gimme
TRAVIS_BRANCH:
for push builds, or builds not triggered by a pull request, this is the name of the branch.
for builds triggered by a pull request this is the name of the branch targeted by the pull request.
for builds triggered by a tag, this is the same as the name of the tag (TRAVIS_TAG).
Note that for tags, git does not store the branch from which a commit was tagged.

TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR: The absolute path to the directory where the repository being built has been copied on the worker.
TRAVIS_BUILD_ID: The id of the current build that Travis CI uses internally.
TRAVIS_BUILD_NUMBER: The number of the current build (for example, “4”).
TRAVIS_BUILD_WEB_URL: URL to the build log.
TRAVIS_COMMIT: The commit that the current build is testing.
TRAVIS_COMMIT_MESSAGE: The commit subject and body, unwrapped.
TRAVIS_COMMIT_RANGE: The range of commits that were included in the push or pull request. (Note that this is empty for builds triggered by the initial commit of a new branch.)
TRAVIS_COMPILER: Indicates the compiler used by the current job (e.g., clang, gcc).
TRAVIS_DEBUG_MODE: Set to true if the job is running in debug mode
TRAVIS_DIST: Indicates the distribution the current job is running on.
TRAVIS_EVENT_TYPE: Indicates how the build was triggered. One of push, pull_request, api, cron.
TRAVIS_JOB_ID: The id of the current job that Travis CI uses internally.
TRAVIS_JOB_NAME: The job name if it was specified, or "".
TRAVIS_JOB_NUMBER: The number of the current job (for example, “4.1”).
TRAVIS_JOB_WEB_URL: URL to the job log.
TRAVIS_OS_NAME: On multi-OS builds, this value indicates the platform the job is running on. Values are currently linux, osx and windows (beta), to be extended in the future.
TRAVIS_CPU_ARCH: On multi-arch builds, this value indicates the CPU architecture the job is running on. Values are currently amd64, arm64, ppc64le and s390x.
TRAVIS_OSX_IMAGE: The osx_image value configured in .travis.yml. If this is not set in .travis.yml, it is empty.
TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST: The pull request number if the current job is a pull request, “false” if it’s not a pull request.
TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST_BRANCH:
if the current job is a pull request, the name of the branch from which the PR originated.
if the current job is a push build, this variable is empty ("").
TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST_SHA:
if the current job is a pull request, the commit SHA of the HEAD commit of the PR.
if the current job is a push build, this variable is empty ("").
TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST_SLUG:
if the current job is a pull request, the slug (in the form owner_name/repo_name) of the repository from which the PR originated.
if the current job is a push build, this variable is empty ("").
TRAVIS_REPO_SLUG: The slug (in form: owner_name/repo_name) of the repository currently being built.
TRAVIS_SECURE_ENV_VARS:
set to true if there are any encrypted environment variables.
set to false if no encrypted environment variables are available.
TRAVIS_SUDO: true or false based on whether sudo is enabled.
TRAVIS_TEST_RESULT: 0 if all commands in the script section (up to the point this environment variable is referenced) have exited with zero; 1 otherwise.
TRAVIS_TAG: If the current build is for a git tag, this variable is set to the tag’s name, otherwise it is empty ("").
TRAVIS_BUILD_STAGE_NAME: The build stage in capitalized form, e.g. Test or Deploy. If a build does not use build stages, this variable is empty ("").
Language-specific builds expose additional environment variables representing the current version being used to run the build. Whether or not they’re set depends on the language you’re using.
